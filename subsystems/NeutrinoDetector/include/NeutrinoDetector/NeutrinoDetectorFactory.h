/**
 * @brief Factory for the Scattering and Neutrino Detector (SND).
 *
 * Builds the SND as a single air container holding three sub-detectors in
 * sequence along the beam (upstream → downstream):
 *
 *   1. Veto      — an upstream PVT scintillator-bar station: three planes of
 *                  seven bars (two horizontal, staggered in Y; one vertical).
 *   2. NuTarget  — a silicon/tungsten sampling target: 120 layers, each a
 *                  tungsten absorber plate followed by an X and a Y silicon
 *                  tracking plane (400 mm reference plate, 11.3 mm pitch).
 *   3. MGC        — a medium-granularity calorimeter: 10 layers, each a tungsten
 *                  absorber plate followed by an X and a Y silicon tracking.
 *   4. HCAL      — a hadronic calorimeter: three transverse sections
 *                  (40/50/60 cm), 14 layers each; every layer is an iron
 *                  absorber, an X and a Y scintillating-fibre plane, and a
 *                  polystyrene tile grid.
 *
 * The geometry follows the repo factory idiom (calorimeter / straw tracker):
 * a `/SHiP/neutrino_detector` air container filled with hierarchically named
 * `GeoPhysVol` children that reuse shared `GeoLogVol`s; sensitive-detector
 * assignment is done downstream by name.
 *
 * Each 0.5 mm scintillating-fibre plane is built from its individual fibres,
 * two staggered sub-layers of 0.25 mm fibres. To keep the node count bounded,
 * the O(300k) identical fibres are not placed one node at a time: a single
 * shared fibre `GeoPhysVol` is multiply placed per sub-layer via a
 * `GeoSerialTransformer`, so each plane costs O(1) tree nodes regardless of
 * fibre count. The X/Y plane names are preserved for readout.
 *
 * The container is a box approximation of the SND envelope
 * (`subsystem_envelopes.csv`: z 26.40–31.50 m WARM, half-width/height up to
 * 0.40 m); placement is handled by SHiPGeometry.
